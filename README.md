# Project NightShade
> This software will be an Action Role-playing game (ARPG), the areas that the player will be exploring will be a brand-new fantasy world created by us. The main setting for the game will be a shop that is owned by the player where he can sell items to other non-playable characters (NPCs). To gather the items the player would then have to access dungeons within the game to battle enemies and bosses. There will be multiple side quests the player can access and complete for rewards that can help them become stronger other ways the player can obtain items which are from monsters, quests and purchasing from other towns. Our game will focus on is losing someone close to you. We will have the player go through the five stages of grief and learn how to cope and grow after the loss of someone allowing the player to learn even without understanding the meaning of the game. A problem currently is with the market we are trying to enter is lacking a game that includes many different features along with a unique theme. Our game will have this which will allow it to flourish in the 2D ARPG market that is currently lacking.

Project Nightshade

   >To go into more detail, Project Nightshade is an Action Role-playing game where the player will take control of the main character and set out on an adventure. They will meet new people, new foes, and earn money by collecting items and selling them either at their very own shop or shopkeepers throughout the world.
  
The World

   >There will be 5 Dungeons in the game. Each dungeon contains 3 levels to complete before the final boss battle. After the boss is defeated you will receive a special chest to open. There will be a chance another chest will spawn in the three levels prior to the boss. There will be areas where you can roam above the dungeons which will contain towns and enemies.

Shops

  >There will be two shops per town. One shop is the blacksmith (Sells weapons and armour) and the other is a Herbalist (Sells potions and items). This excludes the first town which has the players own shop along with the two other shops. The player will possess their own shop that they can sell their items at, where other characters in the game would purchase your items.
  
NPC’s

   >There will be ten NPC’s (non-playable characters) per town. Five of which will have helpful dialog and the remaining 5 will either gift the player items or offer quests, this excludes shopkeepers. NPCs will walk in a specific area and move.
    
Enemies

   >The game will contain two different enemies and five separate bosses. There will be the enemies that are located on the surface and the enemies located in the dungeons. All enemies will drop random loot while the bosses will drop predetermined loot.
  
Towns

   >Towns will include a few buildings (2-3) which will hold the shops and the NPC’S. There will be two towns in total.

Items
  >There will be two different weapon types, which will be wands and swords. The player will also be able to use different armour types to protect them in battle. The enemies will drop different items and treasures that the player could then sell in their own shop or to other shopkeepers.

After reviewing the sketch we decided that there needed to be some changes to make the character more sad and rough. This is the revision

## Development Process

We are going to be using agile development for our project. Doing 2 week sprints to complete tasks. Issues will be created for the features that need to be worked on and assigned to the programmer in charge of that feature/task. We also have Kanban's set up for each programmer to show what they have in progress, what's been completed, and what's pending.
